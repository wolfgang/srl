# SRL - Simple Roguelike

.. in which I develop a "simple roguelike", as a case study in developing software from the outside in, using TDD more often then not.
The main idea, or guideline, if you will, is that of "Differentiating Space", as described by Christopher Alexander in "The Timeless Way of Building":

> Within this process, every individual act of building is a process in which space gets differentiated. 
It is not a process of addition, in which pre-formed parts are combined to create a whole: 
but a process of unfolding, like the evolution of an embryo, in which the whole precedes its parts, 
and actually gives birth to them, by splitting.

Differentiating Code, then? Why not. Let's go with that.

Progress reports & more information will be posted on [Ye Olde Blog](https://wolfgangdeutsch.work/blog/).
