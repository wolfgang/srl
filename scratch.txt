Combat on enemy collision

Feature test
- One-hit an enemy ('E' goes away, next move has no collision)
- 2-hit an enemy


Option 1: Keep randomness
- Must make fuzzy tests against text output (Player hits/misses Enemy [for X damage])
- Must keep hitting in a loop until enemy/player is defeated, with some kind of cut-off

Option 2: Control randomness
- Use domain specific language like "pretend_player_hits_for(damage)"
- Can make precise output tests and behavior tests

Maybe add a randomness test at the end, as a test for using the real random generator

Option 3:
trait CombatEngine
- is_hit(attacker, attackee)
- get_damage_done(attacker)
- apply_damage(attackee)

- Pass controlled CombatEngine to game (game config)
- Can make precise output tests and behavior tests
